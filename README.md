It does not require any login. The prototype can be run as a functioning application by navigating to the top right corner where a "present" button can be located. The prototype has two pathways (following example personas Jack and Amy). Jack's pathway demonstrates an existing user who is looking for a job in Brisbane, QLD. Amy's pathway demonstrates a new user setting up an account and creating an automated resume. The prototype simulates inputted data.
